For example, Digit can get away with a much smaller battery than&nbsp;most large humanoids, because it only really needs to operate for a few minutes at a time before returning to the vehicle to recharge as it drives to the next delivery stop. And while Digit carries several stereo cameras and a lidar, it will have help from its companion robovan to do much of the mapping and path planning required to carry out a delivery. That&rsquo;s an advantage, Ford says, because its autonomous vehicles are equipped with much more powerful sensors and computers than Digit could carry alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Medium post:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>Digit itself will have just enough sensory power to travel through basic situations. If it comes across an unexpected obstacle, it can send an image back to the vehicle and have the car figure out a solution. The car could even send that information into the cloud and ask for other systems to help Digit navigate its environment, providing multiple levels of added assistance while keeping the robot light and nimble.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Digit robot coming out of self-driving van" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzMwNjk5Mg.gif" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image: Ford</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digit will ride in the back of Ford&rsquo;s self-driving delivery vans, unfolding itself at every stop to make a delivery. The robot will rely on the vehicle to recharge its battery as well as for sensing, computing, and connectivity resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a very interesting concept, and to learn more about it (and about how Digit will handle all the rest of this operation), we spoke with&nbsp;Agility Robotics CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damion-shelton-1b5b90a/">Damion Shelton</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum:</em>&nbsp;Offloading the sensing and computing required for autonomous navigation is a very interesting idea&mdash;can you break down what will be done on the robot and what will be done on the vehicle?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Damion Shelton: The exact split is still to be determined, but the basic idea is to run things that require real-time (or close to it) processing on the robot, and push other tasks off-board.

Tasks that could be pushed to the vehicle include storage and retrieval of maps, training of RL behaviors, and initialization of the robot&rsquo;s global pose during deployment.

(3, 2, 'Bringing human-like reasoning to driverless car na', '<p>With aims of bringing more human-like reasoning to autonomous vehicles, MIT researchers have created a system that uses only simple maps and visual data to enable driverless cars to navigate routes in new, complex environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human drivers are exceptionally good at navigating roads they haven&rsquo;t driven on before, using observation and simple tools. We simply match what we see around us to what we see on our GPS devices to determine where we are and where we need to go. Driverless cars, however, struggle with this basic reasoning. In every new area, the cars must first map and analyze all the new roads, which is very time consuming. The systems also rely on complex maps &mdash;&nbsp;usually generated by 3-D scans &mdash;&nbsp;which are computationally intensive to generate and process on the fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a paper being presented at this week&rsquo;s International Conference on Robotics and Automation, MIT researchers describe an autonomous control system that &ldquo;learns&rdquo; the steering patterns of human drivers as they navigate roads in a small area, using only data from video camera feeds and a simple GPS-like map. Then, the trained system can control a driverless car along a planned route in a brand-new area, by imitating the human driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly to human drivers, the system also detects any mismatches between its map and features of the road. This helps the system determine if its position, sensors, or mapping are incorrect, in order to correct the car&rsquo;s course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To train the system initially, a human operator controlled an automated&nbsp;Toyota Prius &mdash; equipped with several cameras and a basic GPS navigation system &mdash;&nbsp;to collect data from local suburban streets including various road structures and obstacles. When deployed autonomously, the system successfully navigated the car along a preplanned path in a different forested area, designated for autonomous vehicle tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With our system, you don&rsquo;t need to train on every road beforehand,&rdquo; says first author Alexander Amini, an MIT graduate student. &ldquo;You can download a new map for the car to navigate through roads it has never seen before.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our objective is to achieve autonomous navigation that is robust for driving in new environments,&rdquo; adds co-author Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. &ldquo;For example, if we train an autonomous vehicle to drive in an urban setting such as the streets of Cambridge, the system should also be able to drive smoothly in the woods, even if that is an environment it has never seen before.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining Rus and Amini on the paper are Guy Rosman, a researcher at the Toyota Research Institute, and Sertac Karaman, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aXI4a_Nvcew" width="560"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Point-to-point navigation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional navigation systems process data from sensors through multiple modules customized for tasks such as localization, mapping, object detection, motion planning, and steering control. For years, Rus&rsquo;s group has been developing &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; navigation systems, which process inputted sensory data and output steering commands, without a need for any specialized modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now, however, these models were strictly designed to safely follow the road, without any real destination in mind. In the new paper, the researchers advanced their end-to-end system to drive from goal to destination, in a previously unseen environment. To do so, the researchers trained their system to predict a full probability distribution over all possible steering commands at any given instant while driving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system uses a machine learning model called a convolutional neural network (CNN), commonly used for image recognition. During training, the system watches and learns how to steer from a human driver. The CNN correlates steering wheel rotations to road curvatures it observes through cameras and an inputted map. Eventually, it learns the most likely steering command for various driving situations, such as straight roads, four-way or T-shaped intersections, forks, and rotaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Initially, at a T-shaped intersection, there are many different directions the car could turn,&rdquo; Rus says. &ldquo;The model starts by thinking about all those directions, but as it sees more and more data about what people do, it will see that some people turn left and some turn right, but nobody goes straight. Straight ahead is ruled out as a possible direction, and the model learns that, at T-shaped intersections, it can only move left or right.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wha', 'uses_AI_for_landing_drone_smoothly.jpg', '2019-05-28 09:58:58', 1, 0, '0000-00-00'),

Officially, the party told reporters on Saturday that Rahul Gandhi&#39;s resignation offer had been &quot;unanimously rejected&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahmed Patel, however, later tweeted that the meeting was about &quot;routine administrative work&quot;. &quot;I had sought time before the CWC to meet the Congress President to discuss routine administrative work. The meeting today was in that context. All other speculation is incorrect and baseless,&quot; his tweet read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement today, the Congress asked the media to &quot;respect the sanctity&quot; of the closed-door meeting of its working committee and &quot;not fall into the trap of conjectures or speculations and await the calibrated efforts by the Congress party towards future course of action&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/what-rahul-gandhi-told-congress-about-resigning-2042991" target="_self">The statement came after reports that at the Working Committee</a>&nbsp;on Saturday, Rahul Gandhi did some tough-talking, reminding party leaders that they had put their sons before the party and &quot;pushed&quot; for their candidature in the Lok Sabha polls. This, it was alleged, had drawn their attention away from the overall campaign in their states, he said, according to sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Gandhi did not name anyone, but description is said to fit Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior leader P Chidambaram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Gandhi reportedly made it clear that he would not &quot;vanish&quot; and would continue to work for the party. &quot;It is not necessary that the president should be from Gandhi family,&quot; sources quoted him as saying firmly. When Priyanka Gandhi&#39;s name came up as an alternative, Mr Gandhi reportedly said: &quot;Don&#39;t drag my sister into it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the starkest symbol of the Congress&#39;s complete collapse in the election, Mr Gandhi also lost his traditional seat Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. He would not be in parliament had he not contested and won from Wayanad in Kerala.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congress was demolished in 17 states, including Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, the states it won in December. The party also failed the test in Karnataka, another state it rules in alliance with HD Kumarasamy. Only in Punjab, where it has been in power since 2017, did Congress win eight of 13 seats. That too, in the backdrop of an unending feud between Navjot Sidhu and his boss, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Gandhi said he took &quot;100 per cent&quot; responsibility for the party&#39;s failure and told the Congress Working Committee -- which comprises 52 members -- that he would like to exit as its top boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="javascript:void(0);"><em>111 COMMENTS</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congress has mostly been led by members of the Nehru-Gandhi family except for several years after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (Rahul Gandhi&#39;s father) was assassinated in 1991. The party did not do well under Sitaram Kesri and several leaders convinced Sonia Gandhi to take over.</p>\r\n', 'rahul.jpg', '2019-05-28 09:58:58', 1, 0, '0000-00-00'),

Excerpts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You are the first Indian to defend and win two Asian Championship titles.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It feels great to have won the Asian Championship again. It was a good week in Kuala Lumpur, especially travelling with the team. On the professional tour it&rsquo;s usually just me so it was nice to have the whole team, including physiotherapist Dimple and Harry (Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu) be there to support us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your opponent in the final, Annie Au, has a strong record against you. How satisfying was it to beat her for the first time since 2017?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annie is tough to play against, mentally and physically. I had lost to her three times so it was extremely satisfying to win the final.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sandhu was courtside when Saurav Ghosal and you won the Asian titles. Your thoughts on banking on fellow players for advice instead of a coach...</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry is a player and has experienced what we as professional players go through and understands the game well. So having him was helpful. At most of my tournaments we help each other because we don&rsquo;t have a full-time coach travelling with us. As Harry is injured (and out) of the tour, he was happy to come with the team and it is great SRFI (Squash Rackets Federation of India) chose to send him with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s been a controversy regarding coach, Cyrus Poncha. SRFI say he was in Malaysia. The players deny which is why they had to help each other during matches.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry, as coach, and our physiotherapist were the only officials who travelled with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the challenges of not having a chief national coach?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I work with my coach, Hadrian Stiff, in Bristol, England, so I keep going as often as I can to train there. Also, I train at the squash academy in Chennai. The coaches at the academy are helpful, but it would be great to have an experienced coach based here or even a part-time coach work with the juniors and seniors. I hope we can get a coach to travel with us on the pro tour as it makes a huge difference to have someone in our corner, helping us in-between games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you view your rivalry with Pallikal? You have a better record (7-2) against her.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a healthy rivalry on court and when I play her it&rsquo;s like playing any other player I compete with on the professional tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have beaten the top-three players (all Egyptians) in the world at least once but lost to players ranked below you.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition is extremely high in the women&rsquo;s game. Everyone is working hard and is so fit and strong with high levels of skill. You have to be at the top of your game from Round 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can Egypt&rsquo;s domination in women&rsquo;s squash be broken?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Egypt are extremely strong and I don&rsquo;t see that changing soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What can be done to improve Indian squash?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need more TV time and better infrastructure, which is monitored by quality coaches and trainers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The disadvantages of squash not being an Olympic sport?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of the sport and financial support from the government and corporates would be a lot more if squash was an Olympic sport.</p>\r\n', 'aa.jpg', '2019-05-28 10:11:01', 1, 0, '0000-00-00'),

Stop smoking.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve started smoking, stop immediately, suggests Quora user Cyndi Perlman Fink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While you can&#39;t undo the damage you may have already incurred from smoking, research suggests that those who quit before age 40 have a 90% lower mortality risk than those who continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Start going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might be tempting to use the weekends to recoup your sleep debt, but Nan Waldman recommends you hit the hay and wake up around the same time every single day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you oversleep for even a few days, experts say you risk resetting your body clock to a different cycle, so you&#39;ll start getting tired later in the day. Avoid a lifetime of sleep issues by sticking to bedtime and wakeup routines whenever you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Start exercising regularly.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Try to move yourself as much as possible,&rdquo; says Alistair Longman. &ldquo;It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s walking, cycling, running, weightlifting, hiking, swimming &mdash; as long as it involves some movement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the later half of your 30s, you start losing muscle mass, so it&#39;s especially important to exercise at this time. But remember to choose physical activities you really love, since you&#39;re less likely to continue exercising if you dislike your workouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Start keeping a journal.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Journal your life! Your written records will entertain and endear in your future,&rdquo; writes Mark Crawley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you&#39;d prefer to keep your musings to yourself, putting your thoughts and feelings on paper can help you deal with stressful events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/21/11/piggy-bank.jpg" title="piggy-bank.jpg" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Getty)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Start saving money.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Building the habit of saving early means you&#39;ll continue it further down the line,&rdquo; says Cliff Gilley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might seem like your golden years are a lifetime away, but the earlier you start saving, the more time your money has to accrue interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Start pursuing a life dream.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&#39;t delay pursuing your life goals,&rdquo; writes Bill Karwin. &ldquo;Want to buy a house? Have kids? Write a book? Pick one of those life goals and get started. What can you do between now and the end of the year to embark on one of them?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Start learning to be happy with what you have.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you are content with what you have, you will have a happier life,&rdquo; says Robert Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s really about gratitude: Research suggests that appreciating what you have can increase happiness and decrease negative feelings. Perhaps that&#39;s why Oprah Winfrey kept a daily gratitude journal for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Stop thinking you need to satisfy everyone.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After I reached 30, I stopped feeling the need to please everyone. You can choose your friends and contacts more carefully,&rdquo; says Kevin Teo. In particular, Teo realised he wasn&#39;t obligated to be nice to people who were unfriendly toward him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you decide to whittle down your Facebook friends to a mere 500 or simply hang out more with the people who make you happy, it&#39;s important to invest your time and energy wisely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Stop comparing yourself to others.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you are unable to do some things in life compared to your siblings and friends, then please be at peace with yourself,&rdquo; advises Mahesh Kay. &ldquo;Don&#39;t be harsh on yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one psychotherapist writes, constantly peering over your shoulder to see what others are doing doesn&#39;t help you accomplish your goals. You&#39;d be better off spending time thinking about what you want to achieve and evaluating your progress on those fronts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10.
