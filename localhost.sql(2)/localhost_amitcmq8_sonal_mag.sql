Our results suggest that they might be able to reduce that bloating, without compromising on healthy fiber, by lowering their sodium intake,&quot; said Noel Mueller, senior author of the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloating is estimated to affect up to a third of US adults overall, and more than 90 per cent of those with irritable bowel syndrome, according to the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloating features a buildup of excess gas in the gut. The production of gas can be attributed to gas-producing gut bacteria breaking down fiber. There is also some evidence that sodium can stimulate bloating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, is the first to examine sodium as a cause of bloating in the context of low- and high-fiber diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study analysed data from the DASH-Sodium trial, conducted</p>\r\n\r\n<p>at four clinical centres during 1998-99. It tested the DASH diet, a high-fiber diet which is relatively low in fat and high in fruits, nuts, and vegetables, against a low-fiber control diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the two diets was tested at three levels of sodium, and the 412 participants all had high blood pressure at the trial start.The trial was set up chiefly to determine the effect of dietary sodium and other factors on blood pressure, but included data on participants&#39; reports of bloating &mdash; data that Mueller and his colleagues analysed for the new study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team found that prior to the trial, 36.7 per cent of the participants reported bloating, which is more or less in line with national surveys of bloating prevalence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They found too that the high-fiber DASH diet increased the risk of bloating by about 41 percent, compared to the low-fiber control diet &mdash; and men were more susceptible to this effect, compared to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the scientists also determined that sodium was a factor in bloating. When they combined data from the DASH and control diets, and compared the highest level of sodium intake to the lowest, they found that the high-sodium versions of those diets collectively increased the risk of bloating by about 27 per cent compared to the low-sodium versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key implication is that reducing sodium can be an effective way to reduce bloating &mdash; and in particular may be able to help people maintain a healthy, high-fiber diet.</p>\r\n', 'salt_AFP.jpg', '2019-07-03 09:15:06', 1, 0, '0000-00-00'),

There are both pros and cons of a digital payments ecosystem. India is not fully equipped to leverage this system,&quot; said New Delhi-based businessman Ajit Khosla who deals in money transfer, travelling and remittance business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For example, while customer liability is limited in case of fraudulent electronic transactions, we do not immediately get the refund. This could be a huge problem for those with limited capital, especially when one is forced to do business only through digital payments,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khosla said that he is currently required to withdraw about Rs. 2 crores a year and uses financial services such as Western Union and MoneyGram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"1\" id=\"google_ads_iframe_/1068322/NDTV_Gadgets_ROS_Native_Outstream_0\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/1068322/NDTV_Gadgets_ROS_Native_Outstream_0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"1\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We get 0.4 percent commission from Western Union but with this new tax we will incur huge loss as customers often demand money in cash,&quot; Khosla said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naresh Kumar, owner of Falcon Cargo Movers in Paharganj, New Delhi agreed with Khosla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We send around 500 packets every day and in doing so we need to incur a lot of cost in cash -- transportation, labour charge and everyday expenses. As we cannot avoid cash payments, the new tax will hit us hard,&quot; Kumar said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tech firms, however, believe that the move will boost digital payments in the whole supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is encouraging that the government is continuing with its policy to promote digital payments in India. The two percent TDS on cash withdrawal of more than Rs. 1 crore a year will encourage the widespread adoption of digital payments,&quot; a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/paytm\" target=\"_self\">Paytm</a>&nbsp;spokesperson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since Prime Minister&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/narendra-modi\" target=\"_self\">Narendra Modi</a>&nbsp;launched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/digital-india\" target=\"_self\">Digital India</a>&nbsp;mission on July 1, 2015, the country has seen a huge growth in digital payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total number of digital payment transactions hit 332.34 crores in March 2019, from just 79.67 crores in October 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are currently several low-cost digital modes of payment such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/bhim-upi\" target=\"_self\">BHIM UPI</a>, UPI-QR Code,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/aadhaar-pay\" target=\"_self\">Aadhaar Pay</a>, certain Debit cards, NEFT, RTGS etc. which can be used to promote a less cash economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan, over two crore rural Indians have so far been made digitally literate. To bridge rural-urban digital divide, Bharat-Net is targeting Internet connectivity in local bodies in every Panchayat in the country. This will be speeded up with assistance from Universal Service Obligation Fund and under a Public Private Partnership arrangement,&quot; Sitharaman said during her speech on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Finance Minister also proposed that business establishments with an annual turnover of more than Rs. 50 crores shall offer low cost digital modes of payment to their customers and no charges or Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) shall be imposed on customers as well as merchants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;RBI and banks will absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to these digital modes of payment,&quot; Sitharaman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Necessary amendments are being made in the Income Tax Act and the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to give effect to these provisions,&quot; she added.</p>\r\n', 'finance_minister_nirmala_sitharaman_reuters_156238', '2019-07-06 05:29:26', 1, 0, '0000-00-00');
